# Hands-On
Hands-on experiments with data science concepts.

The motivation behind this repository is **to provide beginners with tools to explore concepts that are central to data science without having to use math, python or R**.

The first tool in the collection enables hands-on exploration of the [Bias-Variance Tradeoff](Bias-Variance%20Tradeoff%20(README).md) concept.
